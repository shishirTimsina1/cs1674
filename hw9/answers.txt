HW 9 

Part I
	I saw a low performance. I think this is because of the smaller size of training files,
	and maybe something to do with the options we set.
    I was getting accuracy of 0.14

Part II
	I saw a better performance when compared to part_i. The layers imported from AlexNet seem to have
	helped.
    I was getting accuracy of 0.48

Part III
	For some reason I saw less performance in part iii
	I was getting accuracy of 0.33
