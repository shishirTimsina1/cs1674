FINDINGS FOR HW 7 PART 2, SHISHIR TIMSINA

Compare KNN and SVM:
	
	I think my KNN is not completely correct, the accuracy i recieve is much lower 
	although I do see an increase in accuracy with a higher k value, its just very small.
	When compared to the SVM, SVM has an accuracy of 0.565 whereas the best KNN accuracy is
	only 0.01. The plot does not help with the visualization because only the line for SVM 
	is seen properly.
	The other KNN plots are too close to zero. Higher k values seems to result in a higher accuracy
	but KNN does not always have that liner relationship.
