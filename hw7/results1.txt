FINDINGS FOR HW 7 PART 2, SHISHIR TIMSINA

SVM Classifiers:
	As expected, the test_SPM_pyramid was the most accurate. The accuracies were as follows
	test_SPM_pyramid = .5650
	train_SPM_level_1 = .5525
	train_SPM_level_0 = .4175
	
	The higher "level" we went the more accurate we became. However, the first level was gave a 
	bigger jump from level 0 to 1, compared to level 1 to pyramid. We got better results 
	the higher we went because we sort of honed in on a feature in sections rather than look at them
	all at once.
